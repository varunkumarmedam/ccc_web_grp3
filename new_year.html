      <h1> Meet new people:</h1>
      <p> When we get stuck in a rut, we usually end up staying at home most of the time, missing out on a lot of interesting opportunities for networking and having fun. Meeting new people can be beneficial to your mental well-being and help your career, so don’t be afraid to get out there and make some friends. Overcome your shyness, get some knowledge and go and get to know new and interesting people.</p><br><hr>


      <h1>
      Measure activity, not result
    </h1>
         <p>
         New year resolution is one of the hyped modern(pop culture) tradition or some might call it a fad. People promise themselves to do a certain thing on the new years eve. They decide to complete, follow the task for next whole year. In nutshell, it is a noble idea that people pledging something to themselves, this will encourage them to solve some of their problems.
            </p><br><hr>
              
          <h1>Get out of debt:</h1>
         <p> You can’t really move forward in life if you are weighed down by debt. The road to financial freedom is a rocky one, but it is definitely manageable with a bit of planning and self-restraint. Take a look at these strategies and methods and pay off your debt. You won’t believe how good it will feel.</p><br><hr>



         <h1>Reinvent yourself:</h1> 
         <p>If you don’t feel quite happy no matter what you do, it is perhaps time to make some serious changes in your life. Reinventing yourself can give you a whole new perspective on life and take you in directions you may never have dreamed were possible.</p><br><hr>



         <h1> Learn how to defend yourself:</h1>
         <p> Being able to ensure your own safety, and the safety of those you love, is a very important skillset to have. It’s not all about groin kicks and palm strikes, however. You need to learn how to conduct yourself and what kind of behavior to look out for in others.
         Become more romantic: Romance is often the first casualty in longer, more serious relationships, but it doesn’t have to wither away. A few romantic gestures here and there can keep the passion going for decades. It will be fun, even if you’re not the romantic type.</p><br><hr>



         <h1>Start being more creative:</h1>
       <p> There are times when we get mentally fatigued and our creativity just goes out the window. This is particularly bad if your job or hobby depends on you coming up with fresh ideas and thinking outside the box. As with anything else, there are many ressources that help you spark your creativity in a number of different ways.
       Start expressing yourself artistically: While someof us are more logical, with a scientific mind, most people still have a bit of a creative spark in them.Expressing yourself in some creative artistic way is a great form of stress relief and helps keep your mind sharp. Some of these activities will also help you stay active and burn some calories. So go in the arts, write, craft, make DIYprojects – whatever makes your soul free.</p><br><hr>


       <h1>Face your fears and insecurities:</h1>
       <p> You will find this particular point masked beneath other New Year’s resolutions, but fear and insecurity are often the cause of several problems that we want to address. You need to think of it as surviving and controlling your fear rather than overcoming it, and it will enable you to shed off a lot of the insecurities that you have.</p><br><hr>
